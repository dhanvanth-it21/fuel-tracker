New Bike entry
Bike : 
--> Important Bike details
--> current Bike odometer reading : 1000-KM
--> fuel consumption (from date) : 0-L
--> Amount spent on fuel : 0-Rs

New Record for fuel : 
--> On fueling 
------> odometer reading : x-KM;
------> when reserve is on
--------------> true -> Trip F reading : y-KM
--------------> false -> Trip F reading : 0-KM
------> fueled by Rs
--------------> true -> enter the amount spent
--------------> false -> enter the liter added
------> Bunk type and date to fetch the petrol cost via API

New Record for the trip : this trip can be a specific feature or else it is a reading from the odometer
--> Trip A Start
------> Odometer reading (Optional) : x-KM
------> is trip A resetted
--------------> true -> A_Start : 0-KM;
--------------> false -> A_Start : y-KM;
--> Trip A Mid
------> Trip A reading at mid point (can have multiple mid) 
--> Trip A End
------> Odometer reading : x-KM (Optional if the odometer is recorder during the start of trip A)
------> A_End : z-KM


(there can be any number of trip planned at a single travel, where they can be marked under different names)
(few trips can be grouped by the use of labels)(Even a trips mid journey can be labeled) -> this labels will be helpful for grouping the journey and getting insights from them.



data insights : 
1. Mileage
	--> Per trip mileage
	--> Average mileage
	--> Mileage on reserve fuel
2. Fuel Spending
	--> cost per given timeline
	--> Cost per kilometre
	--> total cost spent
3. Distance Tracking
	--> total distance covered
	--> Total distance covered per:
		--> Trip, labels
		--> timeline
		--> Reserve segment
	--> average daily ride distance

	--> km you ride between refuels
 4. Reserve Usage
	--> Count of reserve hits
	--> Average distance covered on reserve
	--> total distance covered on reserve
5. Trip-to-odo synchronization correctness
6. Trip and Label wise 
	--> total distance
	--> reserve hits count
	--> etc...
